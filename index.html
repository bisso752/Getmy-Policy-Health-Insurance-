            <p>It is a fact that health is wealth. But you can’t prove it if you are not taking proper care of it. Today’s sedentary lifestyle becoming a major health concern. While the overall life expectancy has increased significantly, it is also a fact that the number of diseases that affect health is also on a rise.</p>
            <p>In that regard, there is no denying the fact that health insurance plans are a necessity, regardless of your age. With medical inflation, a lot of people turn towards family health insurance to avoid having to pay huge medical bills that can wipe out their entire savings. </p>

<h3>How long does it take to get     insurance money?
    </h3>
 
<p>If you are the beneficiary of a health insurance policy, there must be no delays in the handling of your life insurance claim. As long as the required paperwork is in order and the policy isn’t being contested, a life insurance claim can often be paid within 60 days. However, each claim is different and there may be state regulations that require additional processing time. </p>

            <h3>Planning Ahead </h3>
              
            <p>In a way, health insurance is a lot like car insurance. But, unlike car insurance, health insurance covers far more than just the costs of a bad accident. Health insurance often covers things like annual checkups, vaccinations, preventive health, and other “routine maintenance” for your body and mind. It’s as if car insurance helped pay for oil changes and tire rotations. Therefore it is wise to do planning for your affordable health insurance in advance. </p>

Thanks to the sweeping healthcare reform, signed into law by Barack Obama in 2010, households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) became eligible for subsidies to bring health insurance premiums within reach. </p>
